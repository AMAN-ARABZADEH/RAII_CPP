# RAII Example for File Handling
Example  the RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) principle.


This repository demonstrates the use of RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) in C++ for file handling. 
RAII is a C++ programming technique that ensures resources are properly managed by tying their acquisition to object initialization and their release to object destruction.

## Code Explanation

The code in this repository showcases a `FileHandler` class that encapsulates file handling functionality. The class provides the following methods:

- `FileHandler(const std::string& filename)`: The constructor initializes the `FileHandler` object and acquires the file resource by opening the specified file.
- If the file fails to open, a `std::runtime_error` exception is thrown.

- `~FileHandler()`: The destructor is responsible for releasing the file resource by closing the file.
- When the `FileHandler` object goes out of scope or is explicitly destroyed, the destructor is automatically called.

- `writeData(const std::string& data)`: This method writes the provided data to the file if it is open.

- `readData()`: This method reads the content of the file by resetting the file position to the beginning and then reading each line.
- The content is returned as a string.

The main function demonstrates the usage of the `FileHandler` class. 
It creates a `FileHandler` object, writes data to the file, reads the file's content, and displays it on the console.

## Why RAII and its Importance

RAII is a fundamental concept in C++ that helps ensure proper resource management and prevents resource leaks. 
It ties the acquisition and release of resources to the object's lifetime, making it easier to write robust and exception-safe code.

In this example, RAII is used to manage the file resource. The `FileHandler` class acquires the file in its constructor and releases it in the destructor.
This guarantees that the file is always closed and resources are properly released, even in the presence of exceptions or early returns.
RAII simplifies the code by eliminating the need for manual resource management and enhances code readability, maintainability, and reliability.

By following the RAII principle, we can write safer and more efficient code that automatically manages resources, preventing leaks and ensuring proper cleanup.
